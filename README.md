# Project 3 - "Sports Catalog"
## Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree

## Instructions:
* Run `webserver.py` to start the server
* The web app will run at 'localhost:8000/catalog'

`catalog.db`

### Things to Note
* The default address can be changed at the bottom of `webserver.py` in the
method `app.run`
* You will have to download your own `client_secrets.json` from Google Developer
account and move the file into `/vagrant/catalog/`
